  <b>Be a Burning Man Netherlands Local Contact!</b>
  <p>Burning Man Netherlands is looking for enthusiastic community members to volunteer
    and become a Local Contact.</p>

  <p>In our mission and ever-growing ambition to facilitate and expand the culture that finds its
    roots in the Burning Man Principles, Burning Man Netherlands is looking for eager community
    members to participate as a Local Contact (“LC”).
  </p>

  <p>It’s our vision to bring experiences to people in grand, inspiring and joyful ways that lift
    the human spirit, address social problems and inspire a sense of culture, community and cultural
    engagement by expanding the Burning Man ethos in the Netherlands and facilitating Where the Sheep
    Sleep in the summer season, the Dutch Decompression in the fall and enlarging cultural engagement
    through ArtJump and supporting many smaller get-togethers like local Burning pubs and Town hall
    meetings. In 2019 we see a community more diverse, committed and vibrant, which cannot wait to
    participate and expand the Burning Man culture.
  </p>

  <p>In order to welcome more interest and facilitate initiatives, the Burning Man Netherlands community
    is looking for 5 Local Contacts who are an active and visible participant, that represent our
    programs (Art, Culture, Civic involvement and education) and connects to a growing community and has
    additional expertise to help flourish the Burning Man community as a whole.
  </p>

  <p>
  In close communications with engaged community members in Think Tanks and Town hall meetings, the role
    and purpose of these local contacts have been determined.
    <p>

      spread Burning Man culture to the Netherlands.</li>

    <li> Introduce new LCs, community- and/or event- and project leads within the NL community.</li>
  </ol>
  <br/>

  <p>The process of becoming a LC is open to everyone but, considering the essential role that needs
    to be fulfilled, a couple of requirements must be met:</p>

  <p>Burning Man Netherlands has described 4 interconnected program areas at which extra support and
    development is desired:</p>
  <ol>
    <li> Art</li>
    <li> Culture</li>
    <li> Civic involvement</li>
    <li> Education</li>
  </ol>
  <br/>

  <p>Local contacts that have affinity with or can added value to with one of these program areas are is
    highly appreciated.</p>

  <p>To support communications and online media the Burning Man Netherlands organization is looking for an LC that handles questions and "managed" responses to online media platforms, close collaboration with comms and other Regional Contacts year round and project / event leads during and in preparation for projects / events.
    Additional board member</p>

  <p>The LC’s chosen as representatives will form the Burning Man Netherlands Program Committee. When a solid committee has been established, one of the LC’s will be selected and proposed to take place in the board of Burning Man Netherlands, as a full and equal leveled board member for a period of two years. As such this member will function as a direct representation of the Dutch community at large within the board. Applying for Local Contact doesn’t mean you also have to apply as potential board member.
    Important distinction</p>

  <p>Local Contacts are not Regional Contacts (RCs) who are appointed and contracted by Burning Man
    Projects. A call out for a new RC will be initiated by BMP in 2019. Burning Man Netherlands will
    be involved in this process. A RC function is a function not a title and comes with a more
    specific set of requirements and expectations. For more information please visit
